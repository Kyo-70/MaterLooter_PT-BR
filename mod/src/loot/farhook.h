// within 1 GB of the target and the game's image is surrounded by its own
// DLLs with nothing free nearby, so MH_CreateHook fails there with
// MH_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOC. These hooks steal the first instructions (measured
// with MinHook's HDE decoder, rejected if any is rip-relative), put them in a
// trampoline anywhere in memory, and patch `mov rax, detour; jmp rax` over the
// entry. Other threads are suspended around the write.

    // its twelve-byte patch would land where that mod's trampoline jumps back
    // to. Instead a fourteen-byte relay to the detour goes into a run of int3
    // padding inside the game image, which a rel32 always reaches, and only
    // the jump's four-byte offset changes to point at it. *original jumps on
    // to the other mod's detour, so both run and the original runs last.
